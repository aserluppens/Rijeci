Problem coci13c3p1 from DMOJ

"One day, little Mirko came across a funny looking machine! It consisted of a very very large screen and a single button. When he found the machine, the screen displayed only the letter "A". After he pressed the button, the letter changed to "B". The next few times he pressed the button, the word transformed from "B" to "BA", then to "BAB", then to "BABBA". When he saw this, Mirko realized that the machine alters the word in a way that all the letters "B" get transformed to "BA" and all the letters "A" get transformed to "B".

Amused by the machine, Mirko asked you a very difficult question! After K times of pressing the button, how much letters "A" and how much letters "B" will be displayed on the screen?"

Input Specification:
The first line of input contains the integer K(1 ≤ K ≤ 45) , the number of times Mirko pressed the button.

Output Specification:
